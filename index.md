### Overview
The goal of Snackademic is to give students at UH a way to keep track of all their favorite foodtrucks and restaurants across campus, see what their menu offerings are, filter by style of food, and see what hours they are open. In the case of foodtrucks, the app will let the student view exactly where on campus they are located for the day. The app will also let UH students rate their favorite restaurants by creating user profiles. User profiles can also be created for restaurants and admins.

The app will be built utilizing [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/). Details on how to install and run the application locally will be provided soon.


### Goals:
  * Create a website where students can go to see what food is available, including pages for the following:
    * Food Trucks
    * Resturants/Dining Halls
    * Menus
    * Hours
    * Locations
  * Provide a place to review these food places
    * Written Review individual locations
    * 1-5 star feedback

### Mockup:

### Galaxy Deployment:
You can view our deployed page on Galaxy here: [snackademic.meteorapp.com](http://snackademic.meteorapp.com/)
While we still have a bit of work to do to get our aesthetics smoothed out, but you can see some of the progress via the screenshots below.

The first is our [Landing Page](http://snackademic.meteorapp.com/#/), which is similar to our mockup, but we will be updating the visuals by the next milestone.

Next we have our [Sign Up Page](http://snackademic.meteorapp.com/#/signup), where you can register your account. If you're a student, you can sign up for an account here. If you're a vendor (a restaurant or food truck), you can sign up here as well.

The third page that is currently up for viewing is our [Login Page](http://snackademic.meteorapp.com/#/signin).

Finally we have our [Locations Page](http://snackademic.meteorapp.com/#/map). This page will eventually have a map with exact restaurant and food truck locations along with their hours. You must be logged in to view this page.
