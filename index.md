### Overview
The goal of Snackademic is to give students at UH a way to keep track of all their favorite foodtrucks and restaurants across campus, see what their menu offerings are, filter by style of food, and see what hours they are open. In the case of foodtrucks, the app will let the student view exactly where on campus they are located for the day. The app will also let UH students rate their favorite restaurants by creating user profiles. User profiles can also be created for restaurants and admins.

The app will be built utilizing [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/). Details on how to install and run the application locally will be provided soon.


### Goals:
  * Create a website where students can go to see what food is available, including pages for the following:
    * Food Trucks
    * Resturants/Dining Halls
    * Menus
    * Hours
    * Locations
  * Provide a place to review these food places
    * Written Review individual locations
    * 1-5 star feedback
